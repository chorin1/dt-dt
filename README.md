# Do this Do that
A clojure periodic task dispatcher

## Why?
We love the simplicity of `at-at` but its **really</b>** old, depends on clojure 1.3.0
and has reflection errors.<br>
Some newer libraries don't quite fit - they require java interop for executing a periodic task.  
<br>
This library is intended to be light, simple to use and execute clojure functions idiomatically.
